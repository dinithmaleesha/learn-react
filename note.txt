Tutorial #17

{blogs && <BlogList blogs={blogs} title="All Blogs" handleDelete={handleDelete} />}

how this run ?

At the begining the blogs is null so left side of the && will not true,
which means they do not consider the right side..
After data fetched blogs will be true and then consider the right side also

The code {blogs && <BlogList blogs={blogs} title="All Blogs" handleDelete={handleDelete} />}
uses short-circuit evaluation to conditionally render the BlogList component. Initially,
when blogs is null or undefined, nothing is rendered. Once blogs is populated with data,
the component is rendered.
